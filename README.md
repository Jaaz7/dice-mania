# Dice Mania
**A game where the player bets tokens to guess the total sum of a dice roll.**
<br><br>
Dice Mania is a simple idea which can be compared to classic dice games due to its randomization. It's all about luck and unpredictability, keeping it interesting and fun.

## How To Play
  - The starting screen gives the user an option to read the rules.
  - Once this option is chosen, the player is prompted to charge their balance with the game's currency: tokens.
  - Once the tokens are accepted, a message will indicate it was successfully submitted.
  - The player will then start the game. They will be prompted to pick their bet, their dice number and their play option.
  - The play options are "More", "Less", and "Same".
  - Once chosen, the dice will be rolled and it will be decided whether the player wins or loses. This completes a play.
  - Winning means 2x the bet value, but there's also a jackpot that can be won if the player chooses 4 dice with the option "Same".
  - The player can then choose to continue, to top up or to quit the game. Topping up means adding more tokens to the current balance.
