# Dice Mania
**Dice Mania is a game where the player bets tokens to guess the total sum of a dice roll.**
<br><br>
The starting screen gives the user an option to read the rules.
<br>
Once this option is chosen, the player is prompted to charge their balance with the game's currency: tokens.
<br><br>
Once the tokens are accepted, a message will indicate it was successfully sumbitted.
<br>
The player will then start the game. They will be prompted to pick their bet, their dice number and their play option.
<br><br>
Overall Dice Mania is a simple idea which can be compared to classic dice games because due to its randomization. It's all about luck and unpredictability, keeping it interesting and fun.

## How To Play
The play options are "More", "Less", and "Same". Once chosen, the dice will be rolled and it will be decided whether the player wins or loses. This completes a play.
<br>
Winning means 2x the bet value, but there's also a jackpot that can be won if the player chooses 4 dice with the option "Same".
<br>
The player can then choose to continue, to top up or to quit the game. Topping up means adding more tokens to the current balance.
